This enables objects to\ninteract without requiring to explicitly define listeners and keeping track of\nthem.</p>\n<h3>Event Bus and MVC</h3>\n<p>The Event Bus pattern is especially helpful for decoupling <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller\">MVC</a> \n(or <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Presenter\">MVP</a>) applications.</p>\n<p><strong>One group of MVC</strong> is not a problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.github.com/marcojakob/dart-event-bus/master/doc/mvc.png\"><img alt=\"Model-View-Controller\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/marcojakob/dart-event-bus/master/doc/mvc.png\"></img></a></p>\n<p>But as soon as there are <strong>multiple groups of MVCs</strong>, those groups will have to talk\nto each other. This creates a tight coupling between the controllers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.github.com/marcojakob/dart-event-bus/master/doc/mvc-multi.png\"><img alt=\"Multi Model-View-Controllers\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/marcojakob/dart-event-bus/master/doc/mvc-multi.png\"></img></a></p>\n<p>By communication through an <strong>Event Bus</strong>, the coupling is reduced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.github.com/marcojakob/dart-event-bus/master/doc/event-bus.png\"><img alt=\"Event Bus\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/marcojakob/dart-event-bus/master/doc/event-bus.png\"></img></a></p>\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n<h3>1. Add Dependency</h3>\n<p>Add the folowing to your <strong>pubspec.yaml</strong> and run <strong>pub install</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"yaml\"><code>\tdependencies:\n\t  event_bus: any\n</code></pre>\n<h3>2. Define Events</h3>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>import 'package:event_bus/event_bus.dart';\n\nfinal EventType&lt;User&gt; userLoggedInEvent = new EventType&lt;User&gt;();\nfinal EventType&lt;Order&gt; newOrderEvent = new EventType&lt;Order&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: The generic type of the event (<code>User</code> and <code>Order</code> in this case) is the \ntype of data that will be provided when the event is fired.</p>\n<h3>3. Create Event Bus</h3>\n<p>Create an instance of <code>EventBus</code> and make it available to other classes.</p>\n<p>Usually there is just one Event Bus per application, but more than one may be \nset up to group a specific set of events.</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>EventBus eventBus = new EventBus();\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will instantiate the default implementation of <code>EventBus</code> which is\n<code>SimpleEventBus</code>. You may provide your own <code>EventBus</code> by either extending \n<code>SimpleEventBus</code> or implementing <code>EventBus</code>.</p>\n<h3>4. Register Listeners</h3>\n<p>Register listeners that will be called whenever the event is fired.</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>eventBus.on(userLoggedInEvent).listen((User user) {\n  print(user.name);\t\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>EventBus</code> uses Dart <a href=\"http://api.dartlang.org/docs/releases/latest/dart_async/Stream.html\">Streams</a>\nas its underlying mechanism to keep track of listeners. You may use all \nfunctionality available by the <a href=\"http://api.dartlang.org/docs/releases/latest/dart_async/Stream.html\">Stream</a>\nAPI. One example is the use of <a href=\"http://api.dartlang.org/docs/releases/latest/dart_async/StreamSubscription.html\">StreamSubscriptions</a>\nto later unsubscribe from the events.</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>StreamSubscription&lt;User&gt; subscription = eventBus.on(userLoggedInEvent).listen((User user) {\n  print(user.name);\t\n});\n\nsubscription.cancel();\n</code></pre>\n<h3>5. Fire Events</h3>\n<p>Finally, we need to fire an event.</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>eventBus.fire(userLoggedInEvent, new User('Mickey'));\n</code></pre>\n<h2>License</h2>\n<p>The MIT License (MIT)</p>"},{"packageName":"hop","name":"hop","qualifiedName":"hop/hop","preview":"<p>The main Hop library.</p>","packageIntro":"<p><a href=\"https://raw.github.com/dart-lang/hop/master/resource/logo.png\"><img alt=\"Hop!\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/dart-lang/hop/master/resource/logo.png\"></img></a></p>\n<h2>A Dart framework for reusable tasks</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/hop/latest\"><a href=\"https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/hop/status.png\"><img alt=\"Build Status\" src=\"https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/hop/status.png\"></img></a></a> <a href=\"http://waffle.io/dart-lang/hop\"><a href=\"https://badge.waffle.io/dart-lang/hop.png?label=ready\"><img alt=\"Stories in Ready\" src=\"https://badge.waffle.io/dart-lang/hop.png?label=ready\"></img></a></a></p>\n<h1>Getting started</h1><ul><li>Read <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/hop/wiki\">the wiki</a>.</li><li>Read the <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/hop/blob/master/example/hop_runner.dart\">documented example</a>.</li><li>Check out Hop's <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/hop/blob/master/tool/hop_runner.dart\">hop_runner</a>.</li></ul>\n<h1>Projects using Hop</h1><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/pop-pop-win\">Pop, Pop, Win!</a> - Minesweeper with balloons</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/widget.dart\">Dart Widgets</a> - Reusable Web Components</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/sethladd/lawndart\">Lawndart</a> - Unified, asynchronous, easy-to-use library for browser-based storage.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/johnmccutchan/spectre\">Spectre</a> - Spectre Graphics Engine for Dart</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/johnmccutchan/vector_math\">vector_math</a> - A Vector math library for 2D and 3D applications.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/dart-gde/discovery_api_dart_client_generator\">Dart Client Generator for Discovery APIs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart\">chrome.dart</a> - Dart interop with chrome.* APIs for Chrome Packaged Apps</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevmoo/qr.dart\">qr.dart</a> - Generate QR codes</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevmoo/vote.dart\">vote.dart</a> - Simulate, run, and calculate elections with different election methods</li></ul>\n<h1>Try It Now</h1>\n<p>The <strong>The Hop task management system for Dart</strong> is hosted on <a href=\"http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/hop\">pub.dartlang.org</a>.

It defines the <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html\">Intl</a>\nclass, with the default locale and methods for accessing most of the\ninternationalization mechanisms. This library also defines the\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/DateFormat.html\">DateFormat</a>, <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/NumberFormat.html\">NumberFormat</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/BidiFormatter.html\">BidiFormatter</a> classes.</p>\n<h2>Current locale</h2>\n<p>The package has a single current locale, called <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#defaultLocale\">defaultLocale</a>.\nOperations will use that locale unless told to do otherwise.</p>\n<p>To set the global locale, you can explicitly set it, e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>  Intl.defaultLocale = 'pt_BR';\n</code></pre>\n<p>or get it from the browser by</p>\n<pre><code>  import \"package:intl/intl_browser.dart\";\n  ...\n  findSystemLocale().then(runTheRestOfMyProgram);\n</code></pre>\n<p>To temporarily override the current locale, pass the operation\nto <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#withLocale\">withLocale</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>  Intl.withLocale('fr', () =&gt; print(myLocalizedMessage());\n</code></pre>\n<p>To override it for a very specific operation you can create a format object in\na specific locale, or pass in the locale as a parameter to methods.</p>\n<pre><code>  var format = new DateFormat.yMd(\"ar\");\n  var dateString = format.format(new DateTime.now());\n  print(myMessage(dateString, locale: 'ar');\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Initialization</h2>\n<p>All the different types of locale data require an async initialization step\nto make\nsure the data is available. This reduces the size of the application by only\nloading the\ndata that is actually required. However, deferred loading does not yet work for\nmultiple\nlibraries, so currently all the code will be included anyay, increasing the code\nsize in the short term.</p>\n<p>Each different area of internationalization (messages, dates, numbers) requires\na separate initialization process. That way, if the application only needs to\nformat dates, it doesn't need to take the time or space to load up messages,\nnumbers, or other things it may not need.</p>\n<p>With messages, there is also a need to import a file that won't exist until\nthe code generation step has been run. This can be awkward, but can be worked\naround by creating a stub <code>messages_all.dart</code> file, running an empty translation\nstep, or commenting out the import until translations are available.\nSee \"Extracting and Using Translated Messages\"</p>\n<h2>Messages</h2>\n<p>Messages to be localized are written as functions that return the result of\nan <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#message\">Intl.message</a> call.</p>\n<pre><code>  String continueMessage() =&gt; Intl.message(\n      \"Hit any key to continue\",\n      name: \"continueMessage\",\n      args: [],\n      desc: \"Explains that we will not proceed further until \"\n          \"the user presses a key\");\n  print(continueMessage());\n</code></pre>\n<p>This provides, in addition to the basic message string, a name, a\ndescription for translators, the arguments used in the message, and\nexamples. The <code>name</code> and <code>args</code> parameters are required, and must\nmatch the name and arguments list of the function.  In the future we\nhope to have these provided automatically.</p>\n<p>This can be run in the program before any translation has been done,\nand will just return the message string. It can also be extracted to a\nfile and then be made to return a translated version without modifying\nthe original program. See \"Extracting Messages\" below for more\ndetails.</p>\n<p>The purpose of wrapping the message in a function is to allow it to\nhave parameters which can be used in the result. The message string is\nallowed to use a restricted form of Dart string interpolation, where\nonly the function's parameters can be used, and only in simple\nexpressions. Local variables cannot be used, and neither can\nexpressions with curly braces. Only the message string can have\ninterpolation. The name, desc, args, and examples must be literals and\nnot contain interpolations. Only the args parameter can refer to\nvariables, and it should list exactly the function parameters. If you\nare passing numbers or dates and you want them formatted, you must do\nthe formatting outside the function and pass the formatted string into\nthe message.</p>\n<pre><code>  greetingMessage(name) =&gt; Intl.message(\n      \"Hello $name!\",\n      name: \"greetingMessage\",\n      args: [name],\n      desc: \"Greet the user as they first open the application\",\n      examples: {'name': \"Emily\"});\n  print(greetingMessage('Dan'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is one special class of complex expressions allowed in the\nmessage string, for plurals and genders.</p>\n<pre><code>  remainingEmailsMessage(int howMany, String userName) =&gt; \n    Intl.message(\n      \"${Intl.plural(howMany,\n          zero: 'There are no emails left for $userName.',\n          one: 'There is one email left for $userName.',\n          other: 'There are $howMany emails left for $userName.')}\",\n    name: \"remainingEmailsMessage\",\n    args: [howMany, userName],\n    desc: \"How many emails remain after archiving.\",\n    examples: {'number': 42, 'userName': 'Fred'});\n\n  print(remainingEmailsMessage(1, \"Fred\"));\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, since the typical usage for a plural or gender is for it to\nbe at the top-level, we can also omit the <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#message\">Intl.message</a> call and\nprovide its parameters to the <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#plural\">Intl.plural</a> call instead.</p>\n<pre><code>  remainingEmailsMessage(int howMany, String userName) =&gt; \n    Intl.plural(\n      howMany,\n      zero: 'There are no emails left for $userName.',\n      one: 'There is one email left for $userName.',\n      other: 'There are $howMany emails left for $userName.'),\n      name: \"remainingEmailsMessage\",\n      args: [howMany, userName],\n      desc: \"How many emails remain after archiving.\",\n      examples: {'number': 42, 'userName': 'Fred'});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, there is an <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#gender\">Intl.gender</a> message, and plurals\nand genders can be nested.</p>\n<pre><code>  notOnlineMessage(String userName, String userGender) =&gt; \n    Intl.gender(\n      userGender,\n      male: '$userName is unavailable because he is not online.',\n      female: '$userName is unavailable because she is not online.',\n      other: '$userName is unavailable because they are not online'),\n      name: \"notOnlineMessage\",\n      args: [userName, userGender],\n      desc: \"The user is not available to hangout.\",\n      examples: {{'userGender': 'male', 'userName': 'Fred'},\n          {'userGender': 'female', 'userName' : 'Alice'}});\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Extracting And Using Translated Messages</h2>\n<p>When your program contains messages that need translation, these must\nbe extracted from the program source, sent to human translators, and the\nresults need to be incorporated. This is still work in progress, and\nthe extraction is done to a custom JSON format that is not supported\nby translation tools. We intend to support one or more actual\ntranslation file formats.</p>\n<p>To extract messages, run the <code>pkg/intl/test/extract_to_json.dart</code> program.</p>\n<pre><code>  dart extract_to_json.dart --output-dir=target/directory\n      my_program.dart more_of_my_program.dart\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will produce a file <code>intl_messages.json</code> with the messages from\nall of these programs. This is in a simple JSON format with a map from\nmessage names to message strings.</p>\n<p>The reverse step expects to receive a series of files, one per\nlocale. These consist of a map with the entry for \"_locale\" indicating\nthe locale, and with the function name mapped to the translated\nstring. However, plurals and genders are currently represented in an\nopaque form, by serializing the internal objects that represent\nthem. You can see the generation of this code in the\n<code>make_hardcoded_translation.dart</code> test file.</p>\n<p>If you manage to create such a set of input files, then you can run</p>\n<pre><code>  dart generate_from_json.dart --generated_file_prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; \n      &lt;my dart files&gt; &lt;translated json files&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will generate Dart libraries, one per locale, which contain the\ntranslated versions. Your Dart libraries can import the primary file,\nnamed <code>&lt;prefix&gt;messages_all.dart</code>, and then call the initialization\nfor a specific locale. Once that's done, any\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#message\">Intl.message</a> calls made in the context of that locale\nwill automatically print the translated version instead of the\noriginal.</p>\n<pre><code>  import \"my_prefix_messages_all.dart\";\n  ...\n  initializeMessages(\"dk\").then(printSomeMessages);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the future returned from the initialization call returns, the\nmessage data is available.</p>\n<h2>Number Formatting and Parsing</h2>\n<p>To format a number, create a NumberFormat instance.</p>\n<pre><code>  var f = new NumberFormat(\"###.0#\", \"en_US\");\n  print(f.format(12.345));\n    ==&gt; 12.34\n</code></pre>\n<p>The locale parameter is optional.

We can wrap the string with unicode\ndirectional indicator characters or with an HTML span to indicate\ndirection. The direction can be specified with the\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/BidiFormatter.html#RTL\">RTL</a> and <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/BidiFormatter.html#LTR\">LTR</a> constructors, or\ndetected from the text.</p>\n<pre><code>    new BidiFormatter.RTL().wrapWithUnicode('xyz');\n    new BidiFormatter.RTL().wrapWithSpan('xyz');\n</code></pre>"},{"packageName":"intl","name":"number_symbols","qualifiedName":"intl/number_symbols","packageIntro":"<h1>Intl</h1>\n<p>This package provides internationalization and localization facilities,\nincluding message translation, plurals and genders, date/number formatting\nand parsing, and bidirectional text.</p>\n<h2>General</h2>\n<p>The most important library is <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl.html\">intl</a>. It defines the <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html\">Intl</a>\nclass, with the default locale and methods for accessing most of the\ninternationalization mechanisms. This library also defines the\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/DateFormat.html\">DateFormat</a>, <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/NumberFormat.html\">NumberFormat</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/BidiFormatter.html\">BidiFormatter</a> classes.</p>\n<h2>Current locale</h2>\n<p>The package has a single current locale, called <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#defaultLocale\">defaultLocale</a>.\nOperations will use that locale unless told to do otherwise.</p>\n<p>To set the global locale, you can explicitly set it, e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>  Intl.defaultLocale = 'pt_BR';\n</code></pre>\n<p>or get it from the browser by</p>\n<pre><code>  import \"package:intl/intl_browser.dart\";\n  ...\n  findSystemLocale().then(runTheRestOfMyProgram);\n</code></pre>\n<p>To temporarily override the current locale, pass the operation\nto <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#withLocale\">withLocale</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>  Intl.withLocale('fr', () =&gt; print(myLocalizedMessage());\n</code></pre>\n<p>To override it for a very specific operation you can create a format object in\na specific locale, or pass in the locale as a parameter to methods.</p>\n<pre><code>  var format = new DateFormat.yMd(\"ar\");\n  var dateString = format.format(new DateTime.now());\n  print(myMessage(dateString, locale: 'ar');\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Initialization</h2>\n<p>All the different types of locale data require an async initialization step\nto make\nsure the data is available. This reduces the size of the application by only\nloading the\ndata that is actually required. However, deferred loading does not yet work for\nmultiple\nlibraries, so currently all the code will be included anyay, increasing the code\nsize in the short term.</p>\n<p>Each different area of internationalization (messages, dates, numbers) requires\na separate initialization process. That way, if the application only needs to\nformat dates, it doesn't need to take the time or space to load up messages,\nnumbers, or other things it may not need.</p>\n<p>With messages, there is also a need to import a file that won't exist until\nthe code generation step has been run. This can be awkward, but can be worked\naround by creating a stub <code>messages_all.dart</code> file, running an empty translation\nstep, or commenting out the import until translations are available.\nSee \"Extracting and Using Translated Messages\"</p>\n<h2>Messages</h2>\n<p>Messages to be localized are written as functions that return the result of\nan <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#message\">Intl.message</a> call.</p>\n<pre><code>  String continueMessage() =&gt; Intl.message(\n      \"Hit any key to continue\",\n      name: \"continueMessage\",\n      args: [],\n      desc: \"Explains that we will not proceed further until \"\n          \"the user presses a key\");\n  print(continueMessage());\n</code></pre>\n<p>This provides, in addition to the basic message string, a name, a\ndescription for translators, the arguments used in the message, and\nexamples. The <code>name</code> and <code>args</code> parameters are required, and must\nmatch the name and arguments list of the function.  In the future we\nhope to have these provided automatically.</p>\n<p>This can be run in the program before any translation has been done,\nand will just return the message string. It can also be extracted to a\nfile and then be made to return a translated version without modifying\nthe original program. See \"Extracting Messages\" below for more\ndetails.</p>\n<p>The purpose of wrapping the message in a function is to allow it to\nhave parameters which can be used in the result. The message string is\nallowed to use a restricted form of Dart string interpolation, where\nonly the function's parameters can be used, and only in simple\nexpressions. Local variables cannot be used, and neither can\nexpressions with curly braces. Only the message string can have\ninterpolation. The name, desc, args, and examples must be literals and\nnot contain interpolations. Only the args parameter can refer to\nvariables, and it should list exactly the function parameters. If you\nare passing numbers or dates and you want them formatted, you must do\nthe formatting outside the function and pass the formatted string into\nthe message.</p>\n<pre><code>  greetingMessage(name) =&gt; Intl.message(\n      \"Hello $name!\",\n      name: \"greetingMessage\",\n      args: [name],\n      desc: \"Greet the user as they first open the application\",\n      examples: {'name': \"Emily\"});\n  print(greetingMessage('Dan'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is one special class of complex expressions allowed in the\nmessage string, for plurals and genders.</p>\n<pre><code>  remainingEmailsMessage(int howMany, String userName) =&gt; \n    Intl.message(\n      \"${Intl.plural(howMany,\n          zero: 'There are no emails left for $userName.',\n          one: 'There is one email left for $userName.',\n          other: 'There are $howMany emails left for $userName.')}\",\n    name: \"remainingEmailsMessage\",\n    args: [howMany, userName],\n    desc: \"How many emails remain after archiving.\",\n    examples: {'number': 42, 'userName': 'Fred'});\n\n  print(remainingEmailsMessage(1, \"Fred\"));\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, since the typical usage for a plural or gender is for it to\nbe at the top-level, we can also omit the <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#message\">Intl.message</a> call and\nprovide its parameters to the <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#plural\">Intl.plural</a> call instead.</p>\n<pre><code>  remainingEmailsMessage(int howMany, String userName) =&gt; \n    Intl.plural(\n      howMany,\n      zero: 'There are no emails left for $userName.',\n      one: 'There is one email left for $userName.',\n      other: 'There are $howMany emails left for $userName.'),\n      name: \"remainingEmailsMessage\",\n      args: [howMany, userName],\n      desc: \"How many emails remain after archiving.\",\n      examples: {'number': 42, 'userName': 'Fred'});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, there is an <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#gender\">Intl.gender</a> message, and plurals\nand genders can be nested.</p>\n<pre><code>  notOnlineMessage(String userName, String userGender) =&gt; \n    Intl.gender(\n      userGender,\n      male: '$userName is unavailable because he is not online.',\n      female: '$userName is unavailable because she is not online.',\n      other: '$userName is unavailable because they are not online'),\n      name: \"notOnlineMessage\",\n      args: [userName, userGender],\n      desc: \"The user is not available to hangout.\",\n      examples: {{'userGender': 'male', 'userName': 'Fred'},\n          {'userGender': 'female', 'userName' : 'Alice'}});\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Extracting And Using Translated Messages</h2>\n<p>When your program contains messages that need translation, these must\nbe extracted from the program source, sent to human translators, and the\nresults need to be incorporated. This is still work in progress, and\nthe extraction is done to a custom JSON format that is not supported\nby translation tools. We intend to support one or more actual\ntranslation file formats.</p>\n<p>To extract messages, run the <code>pkg/intl/test/extract_to_json.dart</code> program.</p>\n<pre><code>  dart extract_to_json.dart --output-dir=target/directory\n      my_program.dart more_of_my_program.dart\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will produce a file <code>intl_messages.json</code> with the messages from\nall of these programs. This is in a simple JSON format with a map from\nmessage names to message strings.</p>\n<p>The reverse step expects to receive a series of files, one per\nlocale. These consist of a map with the entry for \"_locale\" indicating\nthe locale, and with the function name mapped to the translated\nstring. However, plurals and genders are currently represented in an\nopaque form, by serializing the internal objects that represent\nthem. You can see the generation of this code in the\n<code>make_hardcoded_translation.dart</code> test file.</p>\n<p>If you manage to create such a set of input files, then you can run</p>\n<pre><code>  dart generate_from_json.dart --generated_file_prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; \n      &lt;my dart files&gt; &lt;translated json files&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will generate Dart libraries, one per locale, which contain the\ntranslated versions. Your Dart libraries can import the primary file,\nnamed <code>&lt;prefix&gt;messages_all.dart</code>, and then call the initialization\nfor a specific locale. Once that's done, any\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/docs/channels/stable/latest/intl/Intl.html#message\">Intl.message</a> calls made in the context of that locale\nwill automatically print the translated version instead of the\noriginal.</p>\n<pre><code>  import \"my_prefix_messages_all.dart\";\n  ...\n  initializeMessages(\"dk\").then(printSomeMessages);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the future returned from the initialization call returns, the\nmessage data is available.</p>\n<h2>Number Formatting and Parsing</h2>\n<p>To format a number, create a NumberFormat instance.</p>\n<pre><code>  var f = new NumberFormat(\"###.0#\", \"en_US\");\n  print(f.format(12.345));\n    ==&gt; 12.34\n</code></pre>\n<p>The locale parameter is optional.

When you use the top-level\nfunctions, it will assume the current platform's path style and work with\nthat.

For example:</p>\n<pre><code>path.join(\"directory\", \"file.txt\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>This calls the top-level join function to join \"directory\" and\n\"file.txt\" using the current platform's directory separator.</p>\n<p>If you want to work with paths for a specific platform regardless of the\nunderlying platform that the program is running on, you can create a\nContext and give it an explicit Style:</p>\n<pre><code>var context = new path.Context(style: Style.windows);\ncontext.join(\"directory\", \"file.txt\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will join \"directory\" and \"file.txt\" using the Windows path separator,\neven when the program is run on a POSIX machine.</p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Where can I use this?</h3>\n<p>Pathos runs on the Dart VM and in the browser under both dart2js and Dartium.\nUnder dart2js, it currently returns \".\" as the current working directory, while\nunder Dartium it returns the current URL.</p>\n<h3>Why doesn't this make paths first-class objects?</h3>\n<p>When you have path <em>objects</em>, then every API that takes a path has to decide if\nit accepts strings, path objects, or both.</p><ul><li>\n<p>Accepting strings is the most convenient, but then it seems weird to have\nthese path objects that aren't actually accepted by anything that needs a\npath. Once you've created a path, you have to always call <code>.toString()</code> on\nit before you can do anything useful with it.</p></li><li>\n<p>Requiring objects forces users to wrap path strings in these objects, which\nis tedious. It also means coupling that API to whatever library defines this\npath class. If there are multiple \"path\" libraries that each define their\nown path types, then any library that works with paths has to pick which one\nit uses.</p></li><li>\n<p>Taking both means you can't type your API.

When writing asynchronous code, a single stack trace isn't very\nuseful, since the call stack is unwound every time something async happens. A\nstack chain tracks stack traces through asynchronous calls, so that you can see\nthe full path from <code>main</code> down to the error.</p>\n<p>To use stack chains, just wrap the code that you want to track in\n<code>Chain.capture</code>. This will create a new <a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/#dart-async.Zone\">Zone</a> in which stack traces are\nrecorded and woven into chains every time an asynchronous call occurs. Zones are\nsticky, too, so any asynchronous operations started in the <code>Chain.capture</code>\ncallback will have their chains tracked, as will asynchronous operations they\nstart and so on.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of some code that doesn't capture its stack chains:</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>import 'dart:async';\n\nvoid main() {\n  scheduleAsync();\n}\n\nvoid scheduleAsync() {\n  return new Future.delayed(new Duration(seconds: 1))\n      .then((_) =&gt; runAsync());\n}\n\nvoid runAsync() {\n  throw 'oh no!';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we run this, it prints the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Uncaught Error: oh no!\nStack Trace: \n#0      runAsync (file:///usr/local/google-old/home/goog/dart/dart/test.dart:13:3)\n#1      scheduleAsync.&lt;anonymous closure&gt; (file:///usr/local/google-old/home/goog/dart/dart/test.dart:9:28)\n#2      _rootRunUnary (dart:async/zone.dart:717)\n#3      _RootZone.runUnary (dart:async/zone.dart:854)\n#4      _Future._propagateToListeners.handleValueCallback (dart:async/future_impl.dart:488)\n#5      _Future._propagateToListeners (dart:async/future_impl.dart:571)\n#6      _Future._complete (dart:async/future_impl.dart:317)\n#7      _SyncCompleter.complete (dart:async/future_impl.dart:44)\n#8      Future.Future.delayed.&lt;anonymous closure&gt; (dart:async/future.dart:219)\n#9      _createTimer.&lt;anonymous closure&gt; (dart:async-patch/timer_patch.dart:11)\n#10     _handleTimeout (dart:io/timer_impl.dart:292)\n#11     _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage (dart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart:115)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how there's no mention of <code>main</code> in that stack trace. All we know is that\nthe error was in <code>runAsync</code>; we don't know why <code>runAsync</code> was called.</p>\n<p>Now let's look at the same code with stack chains captured:</p>\n<pre class=\"dart\"><code>import 'dart:async';\n\nimport 'package:stack_trace/stack_trace.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  Chain.capture(() {\n    scheduleAsync();\n  });\n}\n\nvoid scheduleAsync() {\n  new Future.delayed(new Duration(seconds: 1))\n      .then((_) =&gt; runAsync());\n}\n\nvoid runAsync() {\n  throw 'oh no!';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now if we run it, it prints this:</p>\n<pre><code>Uncaught Error: oh no!\nStack Trace: \ntest.dart 17:3                                                runAsync\ntest.dart 13:28                                               scheduleAsync.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 129:26  registerUnaryCallback.&lt;fn&gt;.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 174:15  StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 177:7   StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 175:7   StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 129:18  registerUnaryCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 717                                      _rootRunUnary\ndart:async/zone.dart 449                                      _ZoneDelegate.runUnary\ndart:async/zone.dart 654                                      _CustomizedZone.runUnary\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 488                               _Future._propagateToListeners.handleValueCallback\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 571                               _Future._propagateToListeners\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 317                               _Future._complete\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 44                                _SyncCompleter.complete\ndart:async/future.dart 219                                    Future.Future.delayed.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 174:15  StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 119:52  registerCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 706                                      _rootRun\ndart:async/zone.dart 440                                      _ZoneDelegate.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 650                                      _CustomizedZone.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 561                                      _BaseZone.runGuarded\ndart:async/zone.dart 586                                      _BaseZone.bindCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 174:15  StackZoneSpecification._run\npackage:stack_trace/src/stack_zone_specification.dart 119:52  registerCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 710                                      _rootRun\ndart:async/zone.dart 440                                      _ZoneDelegate.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 650                                      _CustomizedZone.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 561                                      _BaseZone.runGuarded\ndart:async/zone.dart 586                                      _BaseZone.bindCallback.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async-patch/timer_patch.dart 11                          _createTimer.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:io/timer_impl.dart 292                                   _handleTimeout\ndart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart 115                     _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage\n===== asynchronous gap ===========================\ndart:async/zone.dart 476                   _ZoneDelegate.registerUnaryCallback\ndart:async/zone.dart 666                   _CustomizedZone.registerUnaryCallback\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 164            _Future._Future._then\ndart:async/future_impl.dart 187            _Future.then\ntest.dart 13:12                            scheduleAsync\ntest.dart 7:18                             main.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:async/zone.dart 710                   _rootRun\ndart:async/zone.dart 440                   _ZoneDelegate.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 650                   _CustomizedZone.run\ndart:async/zone.dart 944                   runZoned\npackage:stack_trace/src/chain.dart 93:20   Chain.capture\ntest.dart 6:16                             main\ndart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart 216  _startIsolate.isolateStartHandler\ndart:isolate-patch/isolate_patch.dart 115  _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's a lot of text! If you look closely, though, you can see that <code>main</code> is\nlisted in the first trace in the chain.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, you can call <code>Chain.terse</code> just like <code>Trace.terse</code> to get rid of all\nthe frames you don't care about. The terse version of the stack chain above is\nthis:</p>\n<pre><code>test.dart 17:3   runAsync\ntest.dart 13:28  scheduleAsync.&lt;fn&gt;\ndart:isolate     _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage\n===== asynchronous gap ===========================\ndart:async                                _Future.then\ntest.dart 13:12                           scheduleAsync\ntest.dart 7:18                            main.&lt;fn&gt;\npackage:stack_trace/src/chain.dart 93:20  Chain.capture\ntest.dart 6:16                            main\ndart:isolate                              _RawReceivePortImpl._handleMessage\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's a lot easier to understand!</p>\n<h3><code>Chain.track</code></h3>\n<p>For the most part <code>Chain.capture</code> will notice when an error is thrown and\nassociate the correct stack chain with it. However, there are some cases where\nexceptions won't be automatically detected: any <code>Future</code> constructor,\n<code>Completer.completeError</code>, <code>Stream.addError</code>, and libraries that use these such\nas <code>dart:io</code> and <code>dart:async</code>. For these, all you need to do is wrap the Future\nor Stream in a call to <code>Chain.track</code> and the errors will be tracked correctly.</p>"},{"packageName":"unittest","name":"unittest","qualifiedName":"unittest/unittest","preview":"<p>Support for writing Dart unit tests.</p>","packageIntro":""},{"packageName":"unittest","name":"unittest-compact_vm_config","qualifiedName":"unittest/unittest-compact_vm_config","preview":"<p>A test configuration that generates a compact 1-line progress bar.
